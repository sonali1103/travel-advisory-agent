{"id":1,"question":"If I’m denied boarding because the flight was overbooked, what compensation am I entitled to?","expected_answer":"If you’re bumped involuntarily on a domestic trip: (1) $0 if the airline’s substitute travel gets you to your destination within 1 hour of your original scheduled arrival. (2) If arrival is 1–2 hours late (1–4 hours on international), minimum is 200% of your one-way fare (cap $1,075). (3) If arrival is >2 hours late (>4 hours international) or no substitute travel is arranged, minimum is 400% of your one-way fare (cap $2,150). You also keep your original ticket value for rebooking/refund options, and optional fees you paid (seat/bag, etc.) must be refunded if not provided on the substitute flight."}
{"id":2,"question":"If my flight is delayed overnight, will the airline provide a hotel and meals?","expected_answer":"There are no federal requirements that airlines provide meals or a hotel for flight delays. You have to ask the airline what it will cover, and some airlines may not offer amenities—especially if the delay is due to bad weather or other causes outside the airline’s control."}
{"id":3,"question":"If my baggage is lost, how much is the airline liable for?","expected_answer":"For domestic trips, the DOT-regulated liability limit is currently $4,700 per passenger (max). For many international trips covered by the Montreal Convention, the limit is currently 1,288 Special Drawing Rights (SDR) (max). Actual payouts can be less (e.g., depreciated value), and airlines may require documentation/claims forms."}
{"id":4,"question":"What is United Airlines' policy regarding controllable delays?","expected_answer":"For controllable delays, United commits to: rebooking on the same airline at no additional cost for significant delays; rebooking on a partner/another airline it has an agreement with at no additional cost; meal or meal cash/voucher if the delay causes a wait of 3+ hours; complimentary hotel for an overnight delay; and complimentary ground transportation to/from the hotel for an overnight delay. United does not commit to cash compensation, credit/travel vouchers, or frequent flyer miles for a 3+ hour delay."}
